Scala can be used (and abused) without knowledge about functional programming.   
Attempt to find a proper way of speaking the language can be a long journey.

The 'proper way' is elusive. Depending on who you ask, you'll probably get difference answer.  
Probably in the end there is no proper way, sometimes we just have to keep on going, learning along the way. 

This site contains collections of exercises, inspiring talks highlights and snippets of codes along this journey.  
Exercises, snippets and highlights are presented using [ScalaFiddle](http://scalafiddle.io) so you can 
fiddle around without having to setup libraries needed.
