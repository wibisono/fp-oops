Random snippets that might help improve understanding of FP oops.

1. [Speaking Creature](snippets/speaking-creature) snippets while learning about Typeclass 101 from FP simplified
2. [Kleisli Config](snippets/config-kleisli) the first part of Odersky's talk on [plain FP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXDm3WHZT5g), well this is actually the non plain part.
