<h2> Cats Case Studies </h2>

These are collections of case studies from [Scala with Cats](https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/ "Available for free to download!"). 

1. [Uptime Client](kittens/uptime-client) where we exercise on applicative, and building service once, that can be instantiated differently in the end as asynchronous `Future` or synchronous test. 
2. [Map Reduce](kittens/map-reduce) where we will learn step by step to build map reduce in scala. This contains multiple exercises
3. [Data Validation](kittens/validation) where we will build validation library based on cats.
