Development:

Same building instruction as in [sbt-microsites](https://47deg.github.io/sbt-microsites/docs/build-the-microsite.html) 
- `sbt makeMicrosite` 
- `jekyll serve -s target/site` and have a lookt at http://127.0.0.1:4000/fp-oops/



NOTES 

* Scala fiddle integration source: https://github.com/scalafiddle/scalafiddle-core/tree/master/integrations/jekyll 
* Scala fiddle tag has to be the first thing on the line, careful when including snippets

* Tabs id has to match between navigation and actual tab, and make sure they are unique within page. 
* Need to learn ruby and jekyll to write proper plugins for these.

* Still didn't manage to configure Kazari, if anyone has example microsite with kazari, please ping me.
