NOTES 

* Scala fiddle integration source: https://github.com/scalafiddle/scalafiddle-core/tree/master/integrations/jekyll 
* Scala fiddle tag has to be the first thing on the line, careful when including snippets

* Would be nice if I know how to setup login to github and safe the current exercises
* Scala fiddle seems to already support this, so in theory we also can. 

* Tabs id has to match between navigation and actual tab, and make sure they are unique within page. 
* Need to learn ruby and jekyll to write proper plugins for these.
